# EX.-NO-1-B-IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAYFAIR CIPHER

## AIM:
  To write a C program to implement the Playfair Substitution technique.
  
## ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.

STEP-2: Read the keyword from the user.

STEP-3: Arrange the keyword without duplicates in a 5*5 matrix in the row order and fill the remaining cells with missed out letters in alphabetical order. Note that ‘i’ and ‘j’ takes the same cell.

STEP-4: Group the plain text in pairs and match the corresponding corner letters by forming a rectangular grid.

STEP-5: Display the obtained cipher text.

## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the Playfair cipher substitution technique had been implemented successfully.
